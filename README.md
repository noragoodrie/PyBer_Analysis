# PyBer_Analysis

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project was based on rideshare data for PyBer which was given to us in two csv files which include city_data.csv and ride_data.csv. We needed to take these two datasets to dive into rider and fare metrics by Rural, Urban, and Suburban areas. Throughout this project you will see handfuls of Data Frames as well as visualizations of this data in order for PyBer to improve their services and accessibility in these city types.

**RESULTS**

The chart above shows the Pyber_Summary_DF and within it you can see the 3 city types, which are Rural, Suburban and Urban. You can also see that this DF includes, Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per driver within those 3 city types.

Within the data frame we can see that there are some key findings to our PyBer analysis which will be included in the list below.

1. Urban cities have 1,915 more drivers than Suburban cities and 2,327 more drivers than Rural cities.
2. Rural cities have an average fare per driver of $55+ which is the higest average between the 3 city types.
3. Rural cities have an average fare per ride of $34.62 whichis the highest average between the city types.
4. Urban cities have the highest total rides and total driver. Their average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest of the city tyoes, but we can see that Urban cities have the highest total fares.
5. Refering back to point #4 we can say that the fare revenue is higher by city type especially when the ration between the number of drivers and number of rides is larger.

**PYBER FARE SUMMARY PLOT**

Above you can see the visual that was created to show the Pyber Fare Summary in a more interactive way then the data frame showed at the beginning of the analysis. This plot shows the total fare by city type from the dates of 01-01-2019 to 04-29-2019. The legend in the right corner shows Rural(Blue), Suburban(Red) and Urban(Yellow) city types and their color. 

**SUMMARY**

There are three recommendations I have for this business.
1. Send out marketing ensentives to individuals in the Rural cities to hopefully increase the amount of drivers there are. It seems that due to the fact that there are more total rides than there are drivers in those areas that the increase in drivers will cut down on wait time for customers.

2. If we do a quartarly report on the Total Fare by City Type we may find an answer on how to keep rides more consistant throughout the year.

3. If we do recommendation #2 we may be able to generate promotions during different parents of the year to keep sales high within each city type.
